## Our Objective

One of our hypothetical customers produces consumer goods and asked for
our help. They provided us with some datasets and our objective is to derive
insights that can add value to their business. Due to confidentiality
reasons we don't know their sector and products.

## Datasets

```{r include = F}
library(data.table)

cpi <- fread('Data Science Challenge/data_consumer_price_indices.csv')
expend <- fread('Data Science Challenge/data_consumer_expenditure_survey.csv')
```

We have been provided with data that is available at
[The National Bureau of Economic Research](www.nber.org). The files
contain the following information:

1. Consumer Expenditure Surveys for 1996-2000 containing expenditures, income,
wealth and basic household demographics;
2. Consumer Price Indices for 1990-2000 with prices per quarter.

There is a data dictionary file that describes the data variables,
schema and meanings (`data_dictionary.pdf`).

The 2nd dataset was processed so that the variables are consistent across time.

## Your Task

Use regression, classification and/or clustering methods to derive insights
that can support our mission. If you want you can use more than one of these
approaches.

Execute your approach in R, Python or Julia using a Jupiter Notebook or
Rmarkdown file for the report. Send us the source code and any file that
was generated during this task.

In the report discuss your methodology and justify your choices for the feature
selection and for the algorithms. Share the insights that you obtained from the
model(s) and frame them into a data-driven story that helps our client.
We are interested in your reasoning, curiosity, interpretation, imagination,
algorithmic approach; storytelling-, technical-, reporting- and communication-skills.
